# Interface Types Tools

This repository serves as a collection of tools useful for prototyping code
related to the WebAssembly Interface Types proposal.

Things to read:

* [List of Tools](src/Readme.md) - summary of each tool in this repo
* [Example 05](examples/05%20-%20Self%20Hosting%20%28generated%29/Readme.md) - walks through
  the code and output of each step of a specific sample
* [Article: Replacing Embind](design/article_replace_embind.md) - a motivating
  use-case. How we might use these tools (and Interface Types in general) to
  improve a specific element of the Emscripten toolchain. Something to aim for.
