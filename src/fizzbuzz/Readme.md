# FizzBuzz - v1

This is a proof-of-concept for the ITL file format. ITL stands for "Interface
Types IDL".

The purpose of this version is to demonstrate writing + polyfilling ITL by hand.
Future tools will have more comfortable generation of ITL from the source
language, but this is essentially an asm format for the IT proposal.
