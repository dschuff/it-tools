# Example #4 - Static Component Linking

## Note: Not yet Implemented

This example demonstrates loading multiple modules from a single ITL component.

Here fizzbuzz is implemented as 3 separate modules, all loaded by one larger
component. We use that top-level description to fuse the sub-components into a
single JS polyfill module with all the necessary data.

Note that the C++ code hasn't changed from Example #2.
